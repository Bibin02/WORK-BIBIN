## Projects

### Gesture Tool to maintain Sterility in Surgery 
- **Description**: This project was made as a team in the final year, to help surgeons to maintain a sterile environment using gestures for operating equipment with the help of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. CNN, a deep learning model, is used to recognize gestures.
- **Key Features**:
  - Maintain sterie environment during the surgery.
  - Can train more gestures using this effective CNN model.
    
- **Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning -> CNN,
- **Demo**:

### Fishing hotspot Detection
- **Description**: This is my team project led by me for the fishermen, which I used in the Smart India Hackathon. The machine-learning algorithm deals with finding optimal fish spots in the sea with precise location with the help of satellite data to train it.
- **Key Features**:
  - User Friendly Application.
  - Accuracy of Fishing spots were improved based on Satellite data.
 
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Decisition Trees (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), Javascript, Google Maps API.
- **Demo**: Available in figma and deployment website.
- **Links**: 

### Data Analysis Projects
- **Fifa Player Analysis**: This internship project provides Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the FIFA players using python packages like Seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the performance of each player.
- **Heart Disease Analysis**: Analysis of heart patients and finding patterns to predict a person might get a major heart disease like Heart attack, Stroke, etc. [Notebook Link:](https://github.com/Bibin02/WORK-BIBIN/blob/main/Heart%20Disease%20Data%20Analysis/Heart_Disease_Analytics.html)
- **Birds Strike Analysis**: Designed in Tableau for analysing the Birds stike in Aircrafts and their impact in Aviation industry as well as to the Environment.
