## Projects

### Gesture Tool to maintain Sterility in Surgery 
- **Description**: This project was made as a team in the final year, to help surgeons to maintain a sterile environment using gestures for operating equipment with the help of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. CNN, a deep learning model, is used to recognize gestures.
- **Key Features**:
  - Maintain sterie environment during the surgery.
  - Can train more gestures using this effective CNN model.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning -> CNN, Flask.
- **Demo**: [Click here](https://github.com/Bibin02/WORK-BIBIN)

### Fishing hotspot Detection
- **Description**: This is my team project led by me for the fishermen, which I used in the Smart India Hackathon. The machine-learning algorithm deals with finding optimal fish spots in the sea with precise location with the help of satellite data to train it.
- **Key Features**:
  - User Friendly Application.
  - Accuracy of Fishing spots were improved based on Satellite data.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Decisition Trees (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), Javascript, Google Maps API.
- **Demo**: Available in figma and deployment website. [Click here](https://www.figma.com/proto/cz5CD1Y64wnTuDH1acoYuB/kalasnikov?node-id=164-4&t=8b1noQrpjfGglxOW-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=3%3A12&starting-point-node-id=37%3A8&show-proto-sidebar=1)

### Data Analysis Projects
- **Fifa Player Analysis**: This internship project provides Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the FIFA players using python packages like Seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the performance of each player. [Notebook link](https://bibin02.github.io/WORK-BIBIN/fifa-data-visualization.html)
- **Heart Disease Analysis**: Analysis of heart patients and finding patterns to predict a person might get a major heart disease like Heart attack, Stroke, etc. [Notebook Link](https://bibin02.github.io/WORK-BIBIN/Heart_Disease_Analytics.html)
- **Birds Strike Analysis**: Designed in Tableau for analysing the Birds stike in Aircrafts and their impact in Aviation industry as well as to the Environment. [Click here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bibinus.de.bosco.c/viz/Birds_Strikes_Analytics/BirdsStrikeMain)

### Library Management System
- **Description**: A Java programming based application for the desktop using principles of
software design and App development procedures. The project motive is to
manage library work, and APIs are utilized to link the backend process to a
MySQL database.
- **Key Features**:
- Manage library operations using software Application
- Store all kinds of data and manage it using Mysql Database.
- **Demo**: Extract the zip file to use the jar executable file [Click here](https://github.com/Bibin02/WORK-BIBIN)
